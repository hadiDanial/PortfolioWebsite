# Limberman Dev Log

#### *May 12th, 2019*

You can [play the game here.](http://www.hadidanial.com/blog/2019/5/limberman.html)

## Devlog

There was a lot to do for this game, and I worked on the [Player Controller](#PlayerController), the [Enemies](#Enemies), the Weapons, and the Room system, the tilemap, and several miscellaneous things, and the other programmer handled all character animations, sounds, the shop, UI, and game manager.

I have also recorded (almost) all of the work, and I might be uploading a timelapse video eventually.
