# Launching the Website

#### *April 7th, 2019*

Woohoo! The website is finally up! This was my first web dev project, and I learned *a lot*.

I chose not to use any frameworks or libraries, and build this up from scratch, and I did. I did use a little bit of jQuery, but nothing else.

Choosing a web host was surprisingly difficult... but I ended up going with **//WEB HOST//** because **//XYZ//**.

This was a fun project, and it is finally done! I had to write all the posts over the past few weeks, and it was fun to revisit the memories and projects of the past year. That said, they were also cumbersome to write. The bulk of the website's functionality has been ready for over a month.

I'll be updating this website with more posts as I work on more projects, hopefully starting with the Ludum Dare that's happening this month.

This website will serve as my personal blog, and hopefully as a portfolio/resume for any future work.
